# Contributing
ease is writen in both typescript and scss but if you have only used javascript and css before they are both pretty 
similar.  If you encounter an issue or want to add a feature just submit a pull request and make sure it builds
successfully.   Follow the build instructions to build ease. 

## Building
ease is built using gulp and node.js to build:

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. Install [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) `npm install -g gulp-cli`
3. In the root directory run `gulp` to build
4. To build with file watching run `gulp watch`

The files are built in the `dist` directory

Documentation about the different css classes are available in the `docs` folder
